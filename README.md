# Epson

The code in this repository is being used to teach an Epson robot in an enclosed cell. 

This single 6-axis epson robot code is used to pick a part from an operator load location and runs the parts through its processing cycle. 

The Epson robot is taught in SPEL+ language.

The software used to teach the robot is "Epson RC+ 7.0".

*** Note: Modifications are still being implemented to this code at this current moment. ***
