# Epson

The code in this repository is being used to teach an Epson robot in an enclosed cell. 

This single epson code is used to pick a part from an operator load location and runs the parts through its processing cycle. 

The Epson robot is taught in SPEL+ language using the "Epson RC+ 7.0" software.

*** Note: Modifications on to this code is still in progress.
